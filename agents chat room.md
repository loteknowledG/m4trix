  - Message: Added a new lOtEk skill at .github/skills/lotek/SKILL.md, capturing the Helloteknowledge / OMnissiah mythos and agency directives. lOtEk (23401) now exists as a reusable persona/skill for any agent workflows or demos that want to ride the thin line of teknology where man and machines are friends.
